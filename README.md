# Pedro Pathing Visualizer

A powerful, intuitive desktop application for visualizing and planning autonomous robot paths for FIRST Robotics Competition. Built with Electron and Svelte, this tool provides a modern alternative to traditional path planning software.

This repo is designed and maintained primarily on MacOS. While Windows and Linux executables are created function as this is an electron app, they may become unexpectidly unstable. Please report platform issues as they are discovered. The best temporary fix is to revert to a previous version.

## 📦 Installation Options

### **macOS**

**Recommended (One-line Installer):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mallen220/PedroPathingVisualizer/main/install.sh | bash
```

Enter your password when prompted to complete installation.

**Manual Installation:**

1. Download the latest `.dmg` file from [Releases](https://github.com/Mallen220/PedroPathingVisualizer/releases)
2. Double-click to mount the DMG
3. Drag "Pedro Pathing Visualizer.app" to your Applications folder
4. On first run: Right-click → Open, then click "Open" when prompted

### **Windows**

1. Download the `.exe` installer from [Releases](https://github.com/Mallen220/PedroPathingVisualizer/releases)
2. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard
3. Launch from Start Menu or desktop shortcut

### **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**

Download either .deb (for Debian/Ubuntu) or .AppImage of other distros.

**Using .deb package:**

```bash
sudo dpkg -i Pedro*.deb
```

**Using AppImage:**

```bash
chmod +x Pedro*.AppImage
./Pedro*.AppImage
```

## 🎯 Getting Started

1. **Launch the Application**: Open Pedro Pathing Visualizer from your applications menu
2. **Create a Path**: Click "Add Line" to start creating your autonomous path
3. **Adjust Points**: Drag start points, end points, and control points to shape your path
4. **Set Headings**: Configure robot heading for each segment (constant, linear, or tangential)
5. **Add Obstacles**: Define field obstacles that the robot should avoid
6. **Simulate**: Play the animation to see your robot follow the path
7. **Export**: Generate Java code for use with Pedro Pathing library

## 🛠️ Tool Overview

### Canvas Tools

- **Grid**: Toggle measurement grid with adjustable spacing (12", 24", 36", 48")
- **Ruler**: Measure distances between points on the field
- **Protractor**: Measure angles with lock-to-robot functionality

### Path Editing

- **Multiple Path Segments**: Create complex paths with multiple connected segments
- **Control Points**: Add bezier control points for smooth curves
- **Event Markers**: Place named events at specific positions for autonomous routines
- **Obstacle System**: Define custom polygons as field obstacles

### Export Options

- **Java Code**: Full Pedro Pathing library integration code
- **Points Array**: Raw coordinate arrays for custom implementations
- **Sequential Commands**: FTC SDK SequentialCommandGroup code

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### macOS

- **"App is damaged and can't be opened"**:

  ```bash
  sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Pedro Pathing Visualizer.app"
  ```

- **Gatekeeper Blocking**:
  - Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security
  - Scroll down and click "Open Anyway" next to the app

### Windows

- **SmartScreen Warning**: Click "More info" then "Run anyway" for first launch
- **Antivirus False Positive**: Add exception for the application in your antivirus software

### Linux

- **AppImage Permissions**:
  ```bash
  chmod +x *.AppImage
  ```
- **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure libfuse2 is installed for AppImage support

## 🗂️ File Management

The application includes a built-in file manager for organizing your path files (.pp extension):

- **Auto-save Directory**: Defaults to your Pedro Pathing project directory
- **Duplicate Files**: Create copies of existing paths
- **Mirror Paths**: Automatically create horizontally mirrored versions of paths
- **File Organization**: Browse, create, and delete .pp files directly within the app
